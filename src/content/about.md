Hey all!

My name is Michael Ibragim**chayev**. 👋🏼

I currently work at [AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/), a mobile attribution and marketing analytics company headquartered out of Israel. I’m from New York City and am currently based here as well. I spent a very short year living in San Francisco, CA during my time at my previous company [Datorama](https://datorama.com/), acquired by Salesforce in 2018.

I am one of the co-founders of [Gotham](https://gothamhq.com/) - a soft fork of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) open-source project, a fully functional static site builder built using [Go](https://golang.org/). I'm also working on several other projects including [yURL](https://github.com/chayev/yurl) and BetterQuestions. More details on these projects will be added soon! 

My interests are focused on marketing, entrepreneurship and technology. I enjoy watching theater and shows on broadway. When the weather is nice ☀️ you could find me helping others kayak, kayaking myself, and swimming (I love water 🌊 activities if you can’t tell).

Feel free to [contact me]({{< ref "contact/" >}}) if you would like to connect!
