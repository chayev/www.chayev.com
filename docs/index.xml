      <description>Hey all!
My name is Michael Ibragimchayev. üëãüèº
I currently work at AppsFlyer, a mobile attribution and marketing analytics company headquartered out of Israel. I‚Äôm from New York City and am currently based here as well. I spent a very short year living in San Francisco, CA during my time at my previous company Datorama, acquired by Salesforce in 2018.
I am one of the co-founders of Gotham - a soft fork of the Hugo open-source project, a fully functional static site builder built using Go.</description>
